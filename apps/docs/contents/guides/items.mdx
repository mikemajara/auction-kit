Items describe what bidders are competing for in each auction. Every bid references a specific item by UUID, so items must be created before bidding begins.

## Creating Items

```typescript
import { createItem } from '@auction-kit/drizzle'

const vipSeat = await createItem(db, {
  auctionId: auction.id,
  name: 'VIP Seat',
  description: 'Front row center seat',
  quantity: 1,
})
```

- `name` is required and should be human readable.
- `description` is optional metadata.
- `quantity` defaults to 1 and represents how many winners this item can produce.

Use `getItemsByAuction()` to list every item attached to a given auction.

```typescript
import { getItemsByAuction } from '@auction-kit/drizzle'

const items = await getItemsByAuction(db, auction.id)
```

Fetch a single item when you only need one identifier.

```typescript
import { getItem } from '@auction-kit/drizzle'

const item = await getItem(db, vipSeat.id)
```

## Validations

The database layer now enforces:

- Bids can only reference items that exist.
- The bidder and item must belong to the same auction.
- Items and their bids are deleted automatically if the parent auction is removed.

If a bidder tries to use an item outside their auction, `placeBid()` throws a descriptive error.

## Example Flow

```typescript
const auction = await createAuction(db, config)

const vipSeat = await createItem(db, {
  auctionId: auction.id,
  name: 'VIP Seat',
  quantity: 1,
})

const alice = await createBidder(db, auction.id, 'Alice')

await placeBid(db, {
  auctionId: auction.id,
  bidderId: alice.id,
  itemId: vipSeat.id,
  amount: 250,
})

const state = await getAuctionState(db, auction.id)
console.log(state.items.length) // 1
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Missing item error**: Create the item first and capture its UUID.
- **Wrong auction error**: Double-check that both `bidderId` and `itemId` belong to the same `auctionId`.
- **Quantity confusion**: Quantity controls how many winners can be assigned to an item when multi-unit auctions are enabled; it does not automatically clone items.
